## Paying for {% data variables.product.prodname_sponsors %} via invoice

GitHub lets companies participate in the GitHub Sponsors program via invoice. This can be particularly convenient if your company has an existing invoiced billing relationship with GitHub. Companies paying by invoice get access to a GitHub dashboard that measures open source contributions and activity across the public projects on github.com they're interested in.

This invoiced aspect of the Sponsors program is currently in Beta, and you can request access by talking to your sales representative, or by [contacting us](https://support.github.com/contact/org-sponsors-waitlist).
