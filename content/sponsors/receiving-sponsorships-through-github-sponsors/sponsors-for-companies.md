On github.com, individuals and organizations can create and manage their sponsorships directly. In addition, the GitHub Sponsors program now offers a service to our enterprise customers, many of whom don't use github.com at all. And rather than paying via Stripe like our general GitHub Sponsors program, these customers have the option to pay for this GitHub Sponsors service on top of their existing invoiced billing relationship with GitHub.

We call this aspect of the program “Sponsors for Companies.” The funds you receive under Sponsors for Companies comes directly from GitHub, and your participation in this aspect of the program is subject to  separate terms: the GitHub Maintainer Additional Terms for Optional Data Provision. If you wish to receive funds from GitHub under Sponsors for Companies, you'll be required to complete the agreement before receiving  any of those funds.

Here’s a brief summary of the terms:

* Due to the way the program is set up, you'll receive payment from GitHub, not from another company.
* If taxes are required to be withheld on payment made through this program, GitHub will deduct taxes from the amount owed and pay them to the appropriate taxing authority.
* We'll share some aggregated data on your project(s) or projects you contribute to with the companies that pay for access to this data on a GitHub dashboard . These data fields are outlined in Section 5 of the agreement.
* Data will be aggregated and will not include any User Personal Information (as defined in GitHub’s [Privacy Statement](/github/site-policy/github-privacy-statement)), or any information from private repositories.
* You, as a Maintainer, can terminate the agreement with 14 days notice by contacting us.

If you agree to the terms outlined in the GitHub Maintainer Additional Terms for Optional Data Provision, you will receive a payment from GitHub each time an organization purchases access to the program. The organization purchases access to the dashboard from GitHub for a limited amount of time (for example, one month or one year), and GitHub purchases a license to your data to populate the dashboard. Your financial relationship is with GitHub, not the organization.

You can view and accept the "GitHub Maintainer Additional Terms for Optional Data Provision" agreement from your [{% data variables.product.prodname_sponsors %} dashboard](https://github.com/sponsors/accounts).
